### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

CSS Grid is an area that I will continue to focus on because of the flexibility that comes with developing wireframes of web pages. Pairing Grid with media queries adds a depth to layouts that varies site to site.

### Useful resources

- [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home) - This helped me develop my boilerplate knowledge for HTML and CSS
- [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) - This is an amazing resource that helped me establish a folder structure for every new project that I work on.
